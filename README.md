# Minesweeper-Solver-AI

A Python program designed to solve games of Minesweeper automatically.
Developed as an AI Computer Science project at UC Irvine.
Only "MyAI.py" was developed by me. The rest of the code is framework provided by the university for the project.

Note that the program can only run with Minesweeper "worlds (.txt files)" created with .sh files in the WorldGenerator folder.
